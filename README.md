## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node and NPM installed on your PC.

[Downloading and installing Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

### How To Install

Download the source code using git or else download and unzip the zip file.

Open a terminal window and go to the project root folder.

You need to have npm installed globally.

Run `npm i` to install the required libraries.

### How To Run

Run `ng serve` for a dev server.

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

The browser will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### How To Run End To End Tests

To run the unit tests using Angular *cli*, you need to stop the server.
 
If the server is running, stop the server from the terminal window by pressing *Control-C*.

To run the e2e tests using Angular cli, Run the following command in the terminal window.

`ng e2e -- --protractor-config=e2e/protractor-ci.conf.js`

And if you're running on Windows,
include the `--disable-gpu` flag. See [crbug.com/737678](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=737678).
